# ServerNameExtractor
-Very basic file conversion application for use with .csv file downloads from Queensland Healths Enterprise Sytem Administration.
-Run the application via the .exe application file in the /bin folder.




1. Select the downloaded .csv file from the ESA web page using the browse button.
2. The application will then extract the server names from the file, and display the server names in the textbox below the file path.
3. A new .txt file will be generated automatically in the same location as the selceted file.
4. This .txt file can then be imported into the Windows Remote Desktop Connection Manager to populate servers.



**Please note they will not be sorted into appropriate groups in this version so this will still need to be completed manually.
